Problem Statement
Â Â Â Â 	
Given a sequence of K elements, we can calculate its difference sequence by taking the difference between each pair of adjacent elements. For instance, the difference sequence of {5,6,3,9,-1} is {6-5,3-6,9-3,-1-9} = {1,-3,6,-10}. Formally, the difference sequence of the sequence a1, a2, ... , ak is b1, b2, ... , bk-1, where bi = ai+1 - ai.

The derivative sequence of order N of a sequence A is the result of iteratively applying the above process N times. For example, if A = {5,6,3,9,-1}, the derivative sequence of order 2 is: {5,6,3,9,-1} -> {1,-3,6,-10} -> {-3-1,6-(-3),-10-6} = {-4,9,-16}.

You will be given a sequence a as a int[] and the order n. Return a int[] representing the derivative sequence of order n of a.
